  <p>All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Just make little strokes like that. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
  </P>

  <p>Let's build an almighty mountain. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.
  </p>

  <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
  </P>

  <p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.
  </P>

  <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.
  </p>

  <p>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We'll have a super time.
  </p>
  <p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Use your imagination, let it go.
  </p>
